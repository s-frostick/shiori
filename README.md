## Features

- Simple and clean command line interface.
- Basic bookmarks management i.e. add, edit and delete.
- Search bookmarks by their title, tags, url and page content.
- Import and export bookmarks from and to Netscape Bookmark file.
- Portable, thanks to its single binary format and sqlite3 database
- Simple web interface for those who don't want to use a command line app.
- Where possible, by default `shiori` will download a static copy of the webpage in simple text and HTML format, which later can be used as an offline archive for that page.

## Installation

You can download the latest version of `shiori` from [the release page](https://github.com/s-frostick/shiori/releases/latest), then put it in your `PATH`. If you want to build from source, make sure `go` is installed, then run :

```
go get github.com/s-frostick/shiori
```

## Usage

```

## Advanced

By default, `shiori` will create database in `$HOME/.shiori.db`. If you want to set the database to another location, you can set the environment variable `ENV_SHIORI_DB` to your desired path :

- If `ENV_SHIORI_DB` points to a directory, it will create `.shiori.db` file inside that directory, so the final path for database is `$ENV_SHIORI_DB/.shiori.db`.
- Else, it will create a new database file in the specified path.

## Usage with Docker

There's a Dockerfile that enables you to build your own dockerized Shiori :

```bash
docker build -t shiori .
```

You can also pull the latest automated build from Docker Hub :

```bash
docker pull radhifadlillah/shiori
```

### Run the container

After building the image you will be able to start a container from it. To
preserve the database you need to bind the file. In this example we're locating
the `shiori.db` file in our CWD.

```sh
touch shiori.db
docker run --rm --name shiori -p 8080:8080 -v $(pwd)/shiori.db:/srv/shiori.db radhifadlillah/shiori
```

If you want to run the container in the background add `-d` after `run`.

### Console access for container

```sh
# First open a console to the container (as you will need to enter your password)
# and the default tty does not support hidden inputs
docker exec -it shiori sh
```

### Initialize shiori with password

As after running the container there will be no accounts created, you need to
open a console within your container and run the following command:

```sh
shiori account add <your-desired-username>
Password: <enter-your-password>
```

And you're now ready to go and access shiori via web.

### Run Shiori docker container as systemd image

1. Create a service unit for `systemd` at `/etc/systemd/system/shiori.service`.

    ```ini
    [Unit]
    Description=Shiori container
    After=docker.service

    [Service]
    Restart=always
    ExecStartPre=-/usr/bin/docker rm shiori-1
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker run \
      --rm \
      --name shiori-1 \
      -p 8080:8080 \
      -v /srv/machines/shiori/shiori.db:/srv/shiori/shiori.db \
      radhifadlillah/shiori
    ExecStop=/usr/bin/docker stop -t 2 shiori-1

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

2. Set up data directory

    This assumes, that the Shiori container has a runtime directory to store their
    database, which is at `/srv/machines/shiori`. If you want to modify that,
    make sure, to fix your `shiori.service` as well.

    ```sh
    install -d /srv/machines/shiori
    touch /srv/machines/shiori/shiori.db
    ```

3. Enable and start the container

    ```sh
    systemctl enable --now shiori
    ```

## Examples

*Hint:* If you want to practice the following commands with the docker container,
[run the image](#run-the-container) and [open a
console](#console-access-for-container). After that go along with the examples.
